We were attracted towards a particular passage in the Bible (i.e.) Acts chapter 6 and versus 1 to 6.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have understood from the Bible that efforts were taken by the early churches to protect the interests of&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 2rem;">Widows and deserted women.</span></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have noticed that throughout the world, these women had gone through terrible difficulties, the church and the people of God in the old and New Testament paid so much of attention towards them and received abundant god's blessings.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In India, in the olden days the practice of 'Sati' (widow should die on the funeral fire of her Husband) was abolished as per Law through this law, the practice of SATI had come to an end. Yet the difficulties that these widows and abandoned women face are more cruel than 'Sati'.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To alleviate the Sufferings of these women our trust is launching a Project.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Our Objectives:</strong></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;Efforts will be taken to provide employment, self-employment and methods of economic emancipation to the widows and deserted women.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>2.</strong> Regular education to the children of widows and deserted women.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>3.&nbsp;</strong>Full medical care to widows and abandoned women and their children.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beloved in Christ! We know that our churches have been helping the poor and needy people in addition to performing spiritual work. Now by reading this, you can also participate by paying attention and by showing compassion and concern towards widows, abandoned and deserted women. You are invited to involve in this venture.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>How To Help:</strong></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the church and in the locality where you live, identify the Widows and abandoned women who are suffering and with the due permission of the church, bring their full details to our attention! You will be 'Co-ordinator' for our project.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>1.</strong> Let us light the lives of the beloved sisters of Jesus Christ.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>2.</strong> Together with the united hands let us give thanks to the matchless name of Jesus Christ.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the Bible, here and there we find that there is a 'Special Space' in the 'Heart of God' towards such loving sisters. Let us see certain important Biblical portions pertaining to widows !.</div></h4>
